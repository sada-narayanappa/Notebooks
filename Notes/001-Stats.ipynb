    "1. Choose randomly two groups of people, each group consisting of 25 people in each\n",

    "3. Second group are experimenal group who gets the real medication\n",
    "4. They are given the medication at the same time, same location in a sleep lab\n",
    "5. The observers write the quality of sleep from both the groups \n",
    "6. The results are evaluated after two week period to test if medication had an effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiement, the groups were not told who is in **contol** (who got placebo) and who are in **Experimental group**.\n",
    "Such studies are known as \"blind study\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If the observers also not know the distinction of who are in control or otherwise, then the study is called ** Double blind study**. Sometimes it is necessary to not to disclose such information because such knowledge could influence the results..\n"
