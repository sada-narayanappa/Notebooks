    "\n",
    "Some frustrations are; depending on who is interviewing you, you are likely bump into following personalities. Remember you come across these personalities. Instead of getting frustrated, move on. Eventually you will know all the answers and you will land a job.\n",
    "But before you do that, use the following guidelines and learn to overcome the following objections.\n",

    "P Values. The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis ($H_0$) of a study question is true – the definition of 'extreme' depends on how the hypothesis is being tested. A p-value less than alpha-level (a predetermined level) shows probability of making a mistake of rejecting the null-hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "* p-values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way). Always report the p-value so your clients can draw their own conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation \n",
    "\n",
    "** Correlation Vs Causation **\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is relationship of one variable to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could see this via scatter plot or scatter_matrix in python which shows the matrix of plots of one to other\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson's $r$ ($r_p$) and Spearman's r ($r_s$) (both denoted as $\\rho$ for population is another way to test the correlation between two variables). \n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson's gives linear relationship and Spearman's gives monotonic relationship.\n",
    "If they differ look for outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r = \\frac{Covariance(x,y)}{S_x,S_y} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "######  What does Correlation Coefficient (Pearson's r) says   \n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation coefficient gives the strength of the relationship and ranges between [-1,1]. Closer to 1 means stronger the relationship. Positive relationship says, an increase in one, increases the value of the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the $r$ value, we do hypothesis testing to get the $p$ value to see if it is meaningful; i.e. to test the null-hypothesis the \"there is no relationship\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, one should check with the domain knowledge if the relationship is meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ex: what would say, if you found the correlation of number of eggs in a fridge to number of desktop icons? \n",
    "\n",
    "######  Why and what is $R^2$ - Coefficient of determination    \n",
    "\n",
    "** Coefficient of Determination ($r^2$) ** is the percentage of the variation in the dependent variable (y) that can be explained by variation in the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose in a study conducted, age and salary the $R^2$ value was 31%. It means 31% of the variations in salary depends on age. Other 69% may be explained by other factors that are not in the system - perhaps education level, domain where they work, part-time or full-time etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### ** Problem : ** \n",
    "If a researcher found that there was a strong positive correlation between outside temperature and the number of reported acts of violence, does this mean that an increase or decrease in temperature causes an increase or decrease in the number of reported acts of violence? Why or why not?\n",
    "??\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Can you tell stories about misleading stories \n",
    "Always have few stories ready. Use the following hint make up some stories of your own!\n",
    "Or call me for a consulting price to come up with some stories that suits your domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain knowledge:\n",
    "Suppose you have a data set containing age measured in years (age) and number of pets (pets) and found positively correlated.\n",
    "Clearly having more pets does not make time go faster. \n",
    "Similarly rain causes people to take umbrella; but carrying umbrella does not cause rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you can't know even if you have the domain knowledge. \n",
    "In these two examples ** Ambiguous temporal precedence **\n",
    "Suppose you found correlation of people who are happy number of friends.\n",
    "Does having more friends causes you to be happy? or does being happy causes you to have more friends - we don't know. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers note that the smoking is highly correlated with poverty. \n",
    "Therefore, smoking causes poverty and if we reduce smoking we can reduce poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another case ** Third variable problem **\n",
    "students with higher SAT score had higher grades in college. Therefore by increasing the students SAT score, we can increase their grades in college. \n",
    "\n",
    "==> Flaw in this case is, if the cause is due to inherent drive or motivation, intelligence to higher grades. Therefore, even if the students are somehow tricked to study and get higher SAT scores, they will not have that inner drive to continue; \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of ** Post hoc fallacy ** is: people who commit violent video games played violent video games before committing their violent acts. These video games caused violence. \n",

In other words, you can isolate the role of one variable from all of the others in the model. And, you do this simply by including the variables in your model.\n",
