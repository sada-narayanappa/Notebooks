    "Around 1700, Jacob Bernoulli wrote about removing colored balls from an urn in his landmark treatise *[Ars Conjectandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Conjectandi)*, and ever since then, explanations of probability have relied on [urn problems](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=probability%20ball%20urn). (You'd think the urns would be empty by now.) \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, here is a three-part problem [adapted](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/69151.html)  from mathforum.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An urn contains 23 balls: 8 white, 6 blue, and 9 red.  We select six balls at random (each possible selection is equally likely). What is the probability of each of these possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. all balls are red\n",
    "2. 3 are blue, 2 are white, and 1 is red\n",
    "3. exactly 4 balls are white\n",
    "\n",
    "So, an outcome is a set of 6 balls, and the sample space is the set of all possible 6 ball combinations. We'll solve each of the 3 parts using our `P` function, and also using basic arithmetic; that is, *counting*. Counting is a bit tricky because:\n",
    "- We have multiple balls of the same color. \n",
    "- An outcome is a *set* of balls, where order doesn't matter, not a *sequence*, where order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the first issue, I'll have 8 different white balls labelled `'W1'` through `'W8'`, rather than having eight balls all labelled `'W'`.  That makes it clear that selecting `'W1'` is different from selecting `'W2'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second issue is handled automatically by the `P` function, but if I want to do calculations by hand, I will sometimes first count the number of *permutations* of balls, then get the number of *combinations* by dividing the number of permutations by *c*!, where *c* is the number of balls in a combination. For example, if I want to choose 2 white balls from the 8 available, there are 8 ways to choose a first white ball and 7 ways to choose a second, and therefore 8 &times; 7 = 56 permutations of two white balls. But there are only 56 / 2 = 28 combinations, because `(W1, W2)` is the same combination as `(W2, W1)`.\n",

    ">As to the problem of how to divide the 100 Francs, I think I have found a solution that you will find to be fair. Seeing as I needed only two points to win the game, and you needed 3, I think we can establish that after four more tosses of the coin, the game would have been over. For, in those four tosses, if you did not get the necessary 3 points for your victory, this would imply that I had in fact gained the necessary 2 points for my victory. In a similar manner, if I had not achieved the necessary 2 points for my victory, this would imply that you had in fact achieved at least 3 points and had therefore won the game. Thus, I believe the following list of possible endings to the game is exhaustive. I have denoted 'heads' by an 'h', and tails by a 't.' I have starred the outcomes that indicate a win for myself.\n",

To answer this we need to take into account die rolls, chance and community chest cards, and going to jail (from the \"go to jail\" space, from a card, or from rolling doubles three times in a row). We do not need to take into account anything about buying or selling properties or exchanging money or winning or losing the game, because these don't change a player's location. We will assume that a player in jail will always pay to get out of jail immediately. \n",

We call these components **random variables**. For example, when we consider an experiment in which we roll two dice and observe their sum, we could model the situation with two random variables, one for each die. (Our representation of outcomes has been doing that implicitly all along, when we concatenate two parts of a string, but the concept of a random variable makes it official.)\n",

The theorem applies in all but a few pathological cases. \n",

(At this point, neither knows the other’s number, but they do know the numbers are chosen from a standard uniform distribution.) They can choose to keep that first number, or to press the button again to discard the first number and get a second random number, which they must keep. Then, they come out of their booths and see the final number for each player on the wall. The lavish grand prize — a case full of gold bullion — is awarded to the player who kept the higher number. Which number is the optimal cutoff for players to discard their first number and choose another? Put another way, within which range should they choose to keep the first number, and within which range should they reject it and try their luck with a second number?\n",

This is a *stable equilibrium*; consider fixing *B* = 0.61803, and notice that if *A* changes to any other value, we slip off the saddle to the right or left, resulting in a worse win probability for **A**. Similarly, if we fix *A* = 0.61803, then if *B* changes to another value, we ride up the saddle to a higher win percentage for **A**, which is worse for **B**.
